// Flutter is an open-source UI framework developed by Google for building cross-platform applications from a single codebase. It allows developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile (iOS and Android), web, and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).

//        Types of Applications:
// Mobile applications (iOS and Android)
// Web applications
// Embedded applications


  //      (b)Advantages of Using Flutter for Mobile Application Development:
// Cross-Platform Development: Write one codebase for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop).
// Fast Development with Hot Reload: Make changes in the code and see the results instantly without restarting the app.
// Rich and Customizable Widgets: Flutter provides a wide range of pre-designed widgets that are customizable and allow for pixel-perfect designs.


//      (c) What is Dart Programming Language and Why is it Used with Flutter?
// Dart is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language created by Google. 
//It is used with Flutter because:
// Fast Performance: Dart compiles directly to native machine code (ahead-of-time compilation).
// Optimized for UI: Dart is designed to build beautiful and high-performance UIs.
// Hot Reload Support: Dart works seamlessly with Flutter’s hot reload feature for real-time development.


//        (d)Explain the Concept of Hot Reload in Flutter:
// Hot Reload is a feature in Flutter that allows developers to instantly see the results of code changes without restarting the entire application. It works by injecting updated code into the running app, preserving its state.
// How it Improves Developer Productivity:
// Saves Time: No need to restart the app or lose the current state.
// Speeds Up Debugging: Developers can quickly experiment and debug UI changes.
// Improves Workflow: Encourages iterative development and fast prototyping.


//      (e)Features of Flutter That Make It Popular:
// Cross-Platform Development: Build applications for multiple platforms with a single codebase.
// Customizable Widgets: Flutter has a vast library of widgets that can be customized to create any UI.
// High Performance: Flutter apps are compiled directly to native code, ensuring smooth animations and fast execution.


//       (f)Stateful and Stateless Widgets:
// Stateless Widgets:
// Do not have any mutable state.
// Used when the UI does not change dynamically.

// Example: A static button or a label.
// Use Case: A welcome screen with static text and images.

// Stateful Widgets:
// Have mutable state that can change during the app’s lifecycle.
// It is Used when the UI needs to update dynamically based on user interaction.
// Use Case: A form with input fields or a counter app.
